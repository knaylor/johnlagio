Does the 2020 pandemic got you feeling down?  Looking for a place overflowing with oppulance and class? Then Johnlagio is the place for you.

## Activities
* **Pool** Our pool can accomodate multiple people and has a world class pump and aerator.  Beat the heat with friends.
* **Seating** We have multiple seating options: adirondack chairs, folding chairs and a hammock.  Plenty of places to relax.
* **Firepit** Cook smores, become entranced by the flames or just burn some stuff
* **Eat** There's a garden producing fresh cucumbers and tomatos on premises!  There's also a grill so bring what you'd like to eat and cook it up.
